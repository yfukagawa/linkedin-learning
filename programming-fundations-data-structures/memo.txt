// numerical data types

Whole Numbers
- short, 16 bits, -32768 ~ 32767
- int, 32 bits, -2billion ~ 2billion
- long, 64 bits, -(2^63) ~ 2^63

Decimal Numbers
- float, 32 bits, ~7 decimal digits
- double, 64 bits, ~16 decimal digits
//// above are the data types available in Java
//// int and double are also available in the most of languages

JavaScript:
numbers: covers everything above

Python 2: int, long, float, complex
Python 3: long (int)


Signed data types
- have both positive and negative values

Unsigned data type
- have only positive values
- since there is no negative value, their ranges of positive values are twice than signed


// booleans and characters
- boolean -> 0 or 1, 1 bit value; 0 = false, 1 = true
- Int -> 0s and 1s; 32 bits of 0s and 1s
- Double -> 0s and 1s
- Character -> 0s and 1s

// primitive types
// also called basic or value types
- int, short, double, boolean, long char, float


String

Referenced types 
 - data structures
 - Strings
 - they have pointers to point to the address of each data value
 - variableName -> memoryAddress -> value
Primitive types
 - variableName -> data


Array
- collection of elements, where each item is identified by an index or key

Data Structure
- a collection with a defined way of accessing and storing items

Container objects
- such as array, an object that contain multiple primitives or other containers within

Multidimensional array
